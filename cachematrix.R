## Cached version of matrix which efficiently calculates its inverse
## when result is required multiple times.

## Create cached version of matrix.
## This is represented by a list with following 4 functions:
##  - set : Set the underlying matrix.
##  - get : Get the underlying matrix.
##  - setInverse : Set an inverse of the underlying matrix.
##  - getInverse : Get an inverse of the underlying matrix.
##
## Args:
##  x: A underlying matrix represented by the result.
##
## Returns:
##  A list which can be regarded as a cached version of matrix.

    # This function is intended to be used only by `cacheSolve`.

## Calculate an inverse matrix.
## This function uses answer if available from previous call
## for saving time.
##
## Args:
##  x: Cached version of matrix created by `makeCacheMatrix`.
##
## Returns:
##  An inverse matrix of x, non-cached version.
